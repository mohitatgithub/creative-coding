	<title>Double Pendulum</title>
	<h4>
		<p>A binary fractal tree is defined recursively by symmetric binary branching. The trunk of length L splits into two branches of length r(.67*L),
		each making an angle q with the direction of the trunk. Both of these branches further divide into two branches.
		Continuing in this way for infinitely many branchings, the tree is the set of branches, together with their limit (L>4).</p>

		<p>Here I have played with angle(q) which randomly updates with each branching making these trees less symmetric.
		This exercise is inspired by ideas presented in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU&t">Coding Train Video.</a>
		Interesting thing here is that all these random variations are generated using a small recursive function.</p>
