    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum">double pendulum</a> is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.</p>

<p>Here I have added a bit of randomness to initial conditions of mass, gravity &amp; length. This exercise is inspired by ideas presented in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzPe_S-RVE&amp;t=501s">Coding Train Video</a>.</p>
