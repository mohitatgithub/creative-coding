	<title>Double Pendulum</title>

	<font face = "Times New Roman" size = "4">
		<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum">Double Pendulum</a> is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.
		The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.</p>

		<p>Here I have added a bit of randomness to initial conditions of mass, gravity, length & position.
		This exercise is inspired by ideas presented in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzPe_S-RVE&t">Coding Train Video</a>.</p>
